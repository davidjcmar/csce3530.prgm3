Program 3 README
David Cmar

I had several other projects all due at the same time as this program and must have become confused about due dates.
That is what I meant by getting the dates turned around.

I included a makefile with this program as well, so you can just run make in the directory and it should compile the 
server and client programs. It runs basically the same as programming assignment 4, but without the need to direct 
input for the data to be sent.
